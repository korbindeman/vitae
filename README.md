# Vitae

A work-in-progress, GPU accelerated desktop UI library.

### Goals:
- [ ] Immediate mode
- [ ] Text rendering
- [ ] Basic styling
- [ ] Retained mode
- [ ] State management (probably ECS)

This is a project I wanted to do for a while, and I'm doing it as an introduction to graphics programming with wgpu.
