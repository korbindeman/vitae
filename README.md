# Vitae

A work-in-progress, GPU-accelerated desktop UI library.

### Current state
- [x] Fluent builder API
- [x] Basic styling
- [x] Layout engine (basic)
- [x] Text rendering
- [x] State management

Built on top of [Vello](https://github.com/linebender/vello) for 2D rendering and [Parley](https://github.com/linebender/parley) for text layout.

Right now the code and API are both a mess, but the plan is to eventually have a usable, relatively polished library that I can build apps with. To test things as I go, I'm making a simple chess app alongside the library.
