I’ve been wanting to build a desktop UI library for a while, and I’m finally doing it, mainly as a way to learn graphics programming using `wgpu`.

Right now the code and API are both a mess, but the plan is to eventually have a usable, relatively polished library that I can build apps with. To test things as I go, I’m making a simple chess app alongside the library.
